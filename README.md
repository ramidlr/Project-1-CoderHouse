# Project-1-CoderHouse
Stack: HTML, CSS, JS, jQUERY, AJAX.

This was my final project for the JavaScript Course I attended at CoderHouse (2021), on which I learnt JS Vanilla and ES6.
I know it's far from finished but the main evaluation was on the JS functionalities, therefore that was my focus at the time. 

I just approved a bootCamp challenge at @soyHenry (www.soyhenry.com), to deepen my JS knowledge, but intend to remake this project to reflect what I learnt.
